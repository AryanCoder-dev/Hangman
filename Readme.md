Welcome To Hangman


This game is made in C++.


Hangman is a guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. Originally a Paper-and-pencil game, there are now electronic versions

this is an electronic version of hangman and is also singleplayer 
In this version, you have 7 lives, at first, you have to guess a random letter, if the letter is a part of the random word(decided randomly by the computer), you wont lose a life, however if the letter is wrong, you lose a life, this goes on until you guess the word succesfully or lose all of your lives.
